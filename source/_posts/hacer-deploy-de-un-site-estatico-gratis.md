This is a starter template for creating a beautiful, customizable blog with minimal effort. You’ll only have to change a few settings and you’re ready to go.<!-- more -->

## Configuration

As with all Jigsaw sites, configuration settings can be found in `config.php`; you can update the variables in that file with settings specific to your site. You can also add new configuration variables there to use across your site; take a look at the [Jigsaw documentation](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/site-variables/) to learn more.
